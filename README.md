# Grocer Version 2.1
## Developed using Android Studio

- This project is an application development practice blueprint where I can experiment with creating an app that includes Room database components and navigation utilizing fragments.

- This application's development was started early 2018, and its current version was last updated in July, 2019. 

- Development will always be ongoing as I use the application to test my skills at complete app and industry competancy skills development.
